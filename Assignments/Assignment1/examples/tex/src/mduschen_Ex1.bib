abstract = {Pattern formation is a widely observed phenomenon in diverse fields including materials physics, developmental biology and ecology, among many others. The physics underlying the patterns is specific to the mechanisms, and is encoded by partial differential equations (PDEs). With the aim of discovering hidden physics, we have previously presented a variational approach to identifying such systems of PDEs in the face of noisy data at varying fidelities (Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 353:201-216, 2019). Here, we extend our vari-ational system identification methods to address the challenges presented by image data on microstructures in materials physics. PDEs are formally posed as initial and boundary value problems over combinations of time intervals and spatial domains whose evolution is either fixed or can be tracked. However, the vast majority of microscopy techniques for evolving microstruc-ture in a given material system deliver micrographs of pattern evolution over domains that bear no relation with each other at different time instants. The temporal resolution can rarely capture the fastest time scales that dominate the early dynamics, and noise abounds. Furthermore, data for evolution of the same phenomenon in a material system may well be obtained from different physical specimens. Against this backdrop of spatially unrelated, sparse and multi-source data, we exploit the variational framework to make judicious choices of weighting functions and identify PDE operators from the dynamics. A consistency condition arises for parsimonious inference of a minimal set of the spatial operators at steady state. It is complemented by a confirmation test that provides a sharp condition for acceptance of the inferred operators. The entire framework is demonstrated on synthetic data that reflect the characteristics of the experimental material microscopy images.},

abstract = {We present two approaches to system identification, i.e. the identification of partial differential equations (PDEs) from measurement data. The first is a regression-based Variational System Identification procedure that is advantageous in not requiring repeated forward model solves and has good scalability to large number of differential operators. However it has strict data type requirements needing the ability to directly represent the operators through the available data. The second is a Bayesian inference framework highly valuable for providing uncertainty quantification, and flexible for accommodating sparse and noisy data that may also be indirect quantities of interest. However, it also requires repeated forward solutions of the PDE models which is expensive and hinders scalability. We provide illustrations of results on a model problem for pattern formation dynamics, and discuss merits of the presented methods. Pattern formation is a widely observed phenomenon in diverse fields including materials physics, developmental biology and ecology among many others. The physics underlying the patterns is specific to the mechanisms, and is encoded by partial differential equations (PDEs). Models of phase separation [1, 2] are widely employed in materials physics. Following Alan Turing's semi-nal work on reaction-diffusion systems [3], a robust literature has developed on the application of nonlinear versions of this class of PDEs to model pattern for-*},

abstract = {Partial difference equations (PDEs) and variational methods for image processing on Euclidean domains spaces are very well established because they permit to solve a large range of real computer vision problems. With the recent advent of many 3D sensors, there is a growing interest in transposing and solving PDEs on surfaces and point clouds. In this paper, we propose a simple method to solve such PDEs using the framework of PDEs on graphs. This latter approach enables us to transcribe, for surfaces and point clouds, many models and algorithms designed for image processing. To illustrate our proposal, three problems are considered: 1) (p)-Laplacian restoration and inpainting; 2) PDEs mathematical morphology; and 3) active contours segmentation. {\textcopyright} 1992-2012 IEEE.},

@article{Wang2019,
abstract = {We present a contribution to the field of system identification of partial differential equations (PDEs), with emphasis on discerning between competing mathematical models of pattern-forming physics. The motivation comes from developmental biology, where pattern formation is central to the development of any multicellular organism, and from materials physics, where phase transitions similarly lead to microstructure. In both these fields there is a collection of nonlinear, parabolic PDEs that, over suitable parameter intervals and regimes of physics, can resolve the patterns or microstructures with comparable fidelity. This observation frames the question of which PDE best describes the data at hand. This question is particularly compelling because identification of the closest representation to the true PDE, while constrained by the functional spaces considered relative to the data at hand, immediately delivers insights to the physics underlying the systems. While building on recent work that uses stepwise regression, we present advances that leverage the variational framework and statistical tests. We also address the influences of variable fidelity and noise in the data.},

abstract = {Given a sample from a probability measure with support on a submanifold in Euclidean space one can construct a neighborhood graph which can be seen as an approximation of the submanifold. The graph Laplacian of such a graph is used in several machine learning methods like semi-supervised learning, dimensionality reduction and clustering. In this paper we determine the pointwise limit of three different graph Laplacians used in the literature as the sample size increases and the neighborhood size approaches zero. We show that for a uniform measure on the submanifold all graph Laplacians have the same limit up to constants. However in the case of a non-uniform measure on the submanifold only the so called random walk graph Laplacian converges to the weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator.},

@article{Banerjee2019,
abstract = {A graph theoretic perspective is taken for a range of phenomena in continuum physics in order to develop representations for analysis of large scale, high-fidelity solutions to these problems. Of interest are phenomena described by partial differential equations, with solutions being obtained by computation. The motivation is to gain insight that may otherwise be difficult to attain because of the high dimensionality of computed solutions. We consider graph theoretic representations that are made possible by low-dimensional states defined on the systems. These states are typically functionals of the high-dimensional solutions, and therefore retain important aspects of the high-fidelity information present in the original, computed solutions. Our approach is rooted in regarding each state as a vertex on a graph and identifying edges via processes that are induced either by numerical solution strategies, or by the physics. Correspondences are drawn between the sampling of stationary states, or the time evolution of dynamic phenomena, and the analytic machinery of graph theory. A collection of computations is examined in this framework and new insights to them are presented through analysis of the corresponding graphs.},

abstract = {We introduce a nonlocal discrete regularization framework on weighted graphs of the arbitrary topologies for image and manifold processing. The approach considers the problem as a variational one, which consists of minimizing a weighted sum of two energy terms: a regularization one that uses a discrete weighted p-Dirichlet energy and an approximation one. This is the discrete analogue of recent continuous Euclidean nonlocal regularization functionals. The proposed formulation leads to a family of simple and fast nonlinear processing methods based on the weighted p-Laplace operator, parameterized by the degree p of regularity, the graph structure and the graph weight function. These discrete processing methods provide a graph-based version of recently proposed semi-local or nonlocal processing methods used in image and mesh processing, such as the bilateral filter, the TV digital filter or the nonlocal means filter. It works with equal ease on regular 2-D and 3-D images, manifolds or any data. We illustrate the abilities of the approach by applying it to various types of images, meshes, manifolds, and data represented as graphs. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract="This chapter presents a detailed description of the elements that comprise a lattice physics code. Lattice physics codes are used to generate cross section data for nodal codes, where the nodal codes are used to model the coupled neutronics and thermal-hydraulics behavior of the entire reactor core during steady state and transient operation. Lattice physics codes analyze axial segments of fuel assemblies, referred to as lattices, to determine the detailed spatial and spectral distribution of neutrons and photons across the segment. Once the flux distribution is known, the cross sections can be condensed and homogenized into the structure needed by the nodal code. The nodal code then pieces the various lattices together to construct the various fuel assemblies in the reactor core. This chapter is split into individual sections representing the major pieces of a lattice physics code. Section 1 presents a general overview of the computational scheme used for a typical lattice physics code (Knott). The remaining sections of this chapter are used to describe the major pieces in detail. Section 2 describes the contents of the cross section library that accompanies a lattice physics code (Yamamoto). Section 3 discusses the various resonance treatments used in lattice physics calculations (Yamamoto). Section 4 describes a method for removing cross section energy detail without sacrificing too much accuracy (Knott). Section 5 describes the fine-mesh transport calculation on the heterogeneous lattice geometry (Knott). Section 6 discusses the burnup calculation (Yamamoto).

Two methods, Equivalence Theory and Generalized Equivalence Theory which are theoretically capable of eliminating homogenization error are reviewed. Practical means of obtaining approximate homogenized parameters are presented and numerical examples are used to contrast the two methods. Applications of these techniques to PWR baffle/reflector homogenization and BWR bundle homogenization are discussed. Nodal solutions to realistic reactor problems are compared to fine-mesh PDQ calculations, and the accuracy of the advanced homogenization methods is established.
